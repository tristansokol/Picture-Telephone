##Picture-Telephone
*A mobile and desktop friendly picture telephone game made for the Pan-Peason Hackathon 2013*

---

Picture telephone is a game where people alternate drawing pictures of sentance descriptions and describing pictures that others have drawn. A better explanation can be found [here](http://www.greatgroupgames.com/telephone-pictionary.htm) and a demo of the barely still working prototype can be found [here](http://tristansokol.com/hackathon/2013/allgames.php)

Users can start a game with a picture (Drawn from the DK images API), then add descriptions and more images which are processed and stored with PHP & MySQL. All of thise is wrapped up in a jquery mobile UI and is compatible with both desktop and ipad interaction. 

This is mostly for archival purposes, so I haven't added any comments or checked to see if anything works, but if you are really interested, just let me know @tristansokol. You'll have to set up your own mysql database to get any of the code to work.
